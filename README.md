# QuantumChronicle

Welcome to QuantumChronicle, a repository dedicated to simulating time travel scenarios inspired by quantum computing concepts.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find code that explores time-travel simulations using entangled particles and quantum principles. The code is written in Python and uses the Qiskit library for quantum computations.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python and Qiskit installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the Python script to simulate time-travel scenarios.
4. Explore the measurement results and interpret them.

## Code Usage

The main script `time_travel_simulation.py` creates an entangled state and performs measurements. You can adjust the parameters and run the code to experiment with different time-travel scenarios.

## License
